A simple software ray tracer
===========================

This is not a too serious of a project.
I have made this for my own interest and enjoyment.
It should be compatible on all major operating systems, tho this might 
change in the future. Only tested on Linux.

Specs:

 * Customisable materials
 * Customisable objects
 * .ppm and .bmp output


Dependencies:

 * python 3.10 or later
 * ISO C11 compliant C compiler


Building and running:

We use a custom python script for building the executable.
It is licensed under the MIT license.

To compile the executable, please run

```
python3 -m build
```

This is going to output an executable called ``rays`` which you can run.
